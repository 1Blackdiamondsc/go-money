# go-currency
A go implementation for currencies (both fiat and alternate (e.g. crypto)) using money-safe decimals. Suitable for commerce, banking, etc

Looking to use the shopspring/decimal implementation for the monetary amount side.
I also like the way Rhymond/go-money does currency details, so I am stealing that shamelessly as well.
