# go-money
A go implementation for a money-safe Money type, than manages currencies (both fiat and alternate (e.g. crypto))

Looking to use the shopspring/decimal implementation for the monetary amount side.
I also like the way Rhymond/go-money does currency details, so I am stealing that shamelessly as well.
